Cauliflower, beetroot and asparagus salad with mustard-miso dressing

Beyond friendship, love and good health, often what I really want is a delicious salad. One that’s not too difficult to put together and entertains the tastebuds. Not too much to ask, you’d think, but actually, it can be difficult to achieve. So I have decided to dedicate my life to searching for the perfect salad. Today’s recipe, packed with vegetables that roast well, combined with a punchy, miso-and-mustard dressing, is one small step on that journey.
White miso is milder, sweeter and less pungent than brown miso, and you can buy it in big supermarkets, Asian food stores and online.

Prep: 20 min
Cook: 50 min
Serves: 4

3 tbsp olive oil
1 ½ tsp hot smoked paprika
Salt
1 large cauliflower, broken into florets (650g net weight), leaves and stalks saved for another use
500g beetroot, scrubbed and cut into eighths
250g asparagus, woody ends trimmed
100g blanched almonds, roughly chopped
5g dill, leaves picked and chopped
5 sprigs mint, leaves picked (about 3 tbsp)
20g parsley leaves (about 5-6 tbsp)
150g frozen edamame beans

For the dressing
1 tbsp dijon mustard
4 tbsp white miso
1 tbsp red-wine vinegar

Steps
Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. In a large bowl, mix the oil, paprika and a teaspoon of salt, then add the cauliflower and beetroot, and toss to coat. Lift out the vegetables, spread them out in a single layer on a large baking tray, then roast for 30 minutes.
In the same bowl, toss the asparagus and almonds in the remaining oil and paprika, then spread out on a second baking tray and roast for 10 minutes.
While the vegetables are roasting, make the dressing. Put the mustard, miso, vinegar and four tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl, and mix well.
Defrost the edamame in boiling water, drain, then chop the herbs. 
Once the vegetables and nuts are roasted, toss them with the beans, herbs and dressing, arrange on a large platter and serve.
