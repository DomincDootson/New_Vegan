Tofu akuri (pictured above)
Scrambled tofu is not a poor substitute for scrambled egg but a genuine contender in its own right, and silken tofu’s mild personality makes it the perfect vehicle for louder Indian flavours. Here, I’ve cooked the scrambled tofu akuri-style, which is how the Parsi community in Mumbai eat their scrambled eggs, using the holy trinity of ginger, garlic and chilli, and seasoned with cumin and coriander.

Serves 2

500g silken tofu
½ tsp cumin seeds 
2 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 large red onion, peeled and very finely chopped 
1 green finger chilli, very finely chopped 
1 garlic clove, peeled and grated 
1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 
1 medium sweet vine tomato, finely chopped 
2 tbsp coriander leaves and stalks, finely chopped 
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp salt
4 slices bread, toasted

Silken, or “soft”, tofu can be found in most big supermarkets or south-east Asian food stores. Serve this on toast with ketchup and a pot of fresh chai.

Steps
Line a sieve with kitchen paper or a clean cloth, then gently place the tofu in the sieve and leave to drain over a bowl for at least 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, put the cumin in a mortar and crush to a coarse powder. Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan and, once hot, stir-fry the cumin for a minute, until you can smell it around the kitchen, then add the onion and fry for eight minutes, until soft, sweet and browning. Add the chilli, garlic and ginger, fry for two minutes, then stir in the tomato, coriander, turmeric and salt.
With clean hands, crush the tofu between your fingers into the pan (or mash it in with a potato masher) and cook for a few minutes more, until it’s piping hot and well mixed with the other ingredients. Pile on to the toast and serve immediately.
